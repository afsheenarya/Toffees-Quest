Purpose of program

Welcome to Toffee’s Quest, a platform game containing

The purpose of our program is to provide a fun experience to users. Users may pass 3 levels to reach the end puzzle, where they will use their coding skills to fill in 3 blanks. A stats page keeps track of the user’s wins and losses. 

User Guide

Once the user opens the program, the home panel will appear, displaying 3 clickable buttons.
